coded by bebeli55 but putting it here cuz repo is private

how 2 use

type ++gui in chat
put your coordinates in the corner of the mapart station
make a schematics folder in .minecraft (if u havent already)
then name it mapart-1 mapart-2 etc
activate it

we used skai256's mapart platform, so use it

happy dithering
